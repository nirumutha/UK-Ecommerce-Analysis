TECHNOLOGY STACK RECOMMENDATIONS
===============================

RECOMMENDED APPROACH: HYBRID PYTHON + TABLEAU + SQL
--------------------------------------------------

PRIMARY TOOLS:
1. PYTHON (70% of analysis)
   - pandas, numpy: Data manipulation
   - matplotlib, seaborn, plotly: Visualization
   - scikit-learn: Machine learning
   - statsmodels: Statistical modeling
   - jupyter notebooks: Interactive analysis

2. SQL (15% of analysis)
   - Data preparation and cleaning
   - Complex joins across datasets
   - Aggregations and transformations
   - Database management (SQLite/PostgreSQL)

3. TABLEAU (15% of analysis)
   - Executive dashboards
   - Interactive visualizations
   - Geographic mapping
   - Stakeholder presentations

WHY THIS COMBINATION?
--------------------
✅ Python: Best for statistical analysis, ML, and complex calculations
✅ SQL: Efficient for data preparation and large dataset handling  
✅ Tableau: Superior for business-friendly dashboards and presentations
✅ Flexibility: Can adapt to different analysis requirements
✅ Scalability: Works from prototype to production
✅ Industry Standard: Most commonly used in business analytics

ALTERNATIVE APPROACHES:
----------------------
Option A: PYTHON ONLY (90% Python, 10% SQL)
- Pros: Single environment, full control, reproducible
- Cons: Visualization not as polished, steeper learning curve
- Best for: Technical audiences, deep statistical work

Option B: TABLEAU + SQL HEAVY (50% Tableau, 40% SQL, 10% Python)  
- Pros: Business-friendly, fast dashboard development
- Cons: Limited statistical modeling, less flexibility
- Best for: Business users, quick insights, executive reporting

Option C: POWER BI + PYTHON (60% Power BI, 30% Python, 10% SQL)
- Pros: Microsoft ecosystem integration, good balance
- Cons: Less statistical power than pure Python approach
- Best for: Organizations using Microsoft stack

RECOMMENDATION: START WITH PYTHON + SQL, ADD TABLEAU FOR FINAL DASHBOARDS
